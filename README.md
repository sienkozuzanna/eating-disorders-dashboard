## Understanding Eating Disorders Dashboard

## Introduction
This project aims to create awareness about the prevalence of eating disorders. The dashboard visualizes data on the share of the world population affected by these disorders across different age groups and countries in 2019.

## About the Dashboard
The dashboard serves as a poster illustrating the prevalence of eating disorders globally and in six countries with the highest rates. It presents static visualizations to highlight the age groups most affected and aims to challenge common misconceptions about eating disorders, including gender distribution and early onset.

## Key Features
- Static visualizations: The poster presents static visualizations showcasing the prevalence of eating disorders across different age groups and countries.
- Comparative analysis: It enables viewers to compare prevalence rates among different countries and age groups through the presented data.
- Educational insights: The poster aims to provide educational insights into the prevalence and impact of eating disorders globally, challenging misconceptions and offering informative content.

## Data Sources
- The data was sourced from epidemiological dataset informing GBD 2019 for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, 2 published systematic reviews that focused on binge eating disorder and/or OSFED and also some studies that were provided by eating disorders experts.
- Additional information and statistics were gathered from https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/eating-disorders-prevalence-by-age.
